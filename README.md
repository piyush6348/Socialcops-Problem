Android Developer Challenge
A selfi geek needs an android application where he can do three things:
* Click photos and then upload them to the cloud
* Record video and posting it to the cloud
* View all uploaded photos and videos

However, he does not want to use the default camera app on his phone.
You need to create an android application in which the user can:
* Can click photos and record video without using intent.
* Save images to cloud (use any backend) and create an image gallery.
* Create grid view, where he can view photos and videos which are being uploaded.
